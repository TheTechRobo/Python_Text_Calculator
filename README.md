This is a Python script I forked when I wanted to learn math in Python.

Learning this has been very interesting and educational. 

I always make my forked repositories better â€” and this one is no exception!  

Thanks for visiting!

# Recommended packages
It's suggested, if you're on Windows, to install `colorama` package (`pip install colorama`), to increase the chances of Palc working correctly. This module is unnecessary (but doesn't harm anything) for all other operating systems.
