Have you ever looked for a complete, simple calculator? Well here you go!

This is a Python script named "Palc" I forked when I wanted to learn math in Python. (UPDATE: And now that you can use it as a module it's even better!) There is almost no code left from the original (mainly because i've added and rewritten so much) but Palc would've been WAY different without the original author - see [lewiswatson55's repo](https://github.com/lewiswatson55/Python_Text_Calculator/) for the original code.

Learning this has been very interesting and educational. 

I always try to make my forked repositories better â€” and this one is no exception!  

Thanks for visiting!

# Recommended packages
It's suggested, if you're using the Windows CMD, to install `colorama` package (`pip install colorama`), to increase the chances of Palc working correctly. This module is unnecessary (but doesn't harm anything) for all other operating systems.
