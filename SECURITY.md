## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, **please** DM me on Discord (I'm TheTechRobo#7420). There is currently no other way; hopefully this will change in the future!

I check my Discord multiple times per day, so I will definitely see your tip.

**If your vulnerability is accepted**, expect it to show up in the _Security_ tab once it is fixed.

**If your vulnerability is declined**, I should have given a reason. If not, ask.
