**Describe the change**  
Do you want a rewrite or a refactor? (A rewrite is where you write new code while only using the existing code for a general idea, a refactor is updating existing code.) Where? Why?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
What would happen if we did a rewrite instead of a refactor, or vice versa? Explain how it could or couldn't work here.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the request here.
